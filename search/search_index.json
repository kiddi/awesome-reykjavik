Reference: reykjavik.is There is currently no official map of postal codes. This was taken from a post on DV.is which references a borken link on Posturinn.is. As you can see from these maps neighborhoods don\u2019t map cleanly to postal codes. Nevertheless the neighboorhoods are frequently referred to by their primary postal codes. Famously the domestic flights airport is located awkwardly centrally, spoiling valuable land that would otherwise help reduce the need for long travel. Its area has recently been given the 102 postcode. The future of this area has been a source of political contention, but very likely the airport will gradually make way for a new central neighbourhood with mixed housing. Since the war period the capital area has sprawled out with a car centric plan, especially in surrounding municipalities. Only in the last 10 years or so have the regional plans called for more walkable patterns and mixed housing areas. The result is that only Vesturb\u00e6r, Mi\u00f0borg, Hl\u00ed\u00f0ar, Laugardalur and some parts of Laugardalur are actually walkable and bike friendly. Mi\u00f0b\u00e6r (a.k.a. Downtown, 101 postcode) \u00b6 This is the downtown area and \u201eold town\u201c. This is where service, cafe\u2019s, clubs and restaurants are clustered here. This is by far the most touristy area with a density of high hotel and tourist accommodation. On friday and saturday nights young Icelander\u2019s travel from all over the capital area to party in the clubs in and around Laugavegur/Bankastr\u00e6ti. Landmarks: Hallgr\u00edmskirkja, Al\u00feingi (The Parliament), Landsp\u00edtali, BS\u00cd bus terminal, Laugavegur (the \u201emain\u201c street), City Hall, domestic flights airport, University of Iceland. Vesturb\u00e6r (107 postcode, with parts of 101) \u00b6 Has semi-walkable parts, the KR sports club and charming family housing. Not many offices. Has the University and Mi\u00f0b\u00e6r area in walking distance. Landmarks: Vesturb\u00e6jarlaug (popular swimming pool) and a big part of the university campus. Hl\u00ed\u00f0ar (105) \u00b6 Hl\u00ed\u00f0ar and Vesturb\u00e6r sandwich the Mi\u00f0b\u00e6r downtown area. Hl\u00ed\u00f0ar also has primarily family housing. It is unfortunately cut up with the Miklabraut highway bringing traffic from the capital area to the downtown area. Landmarks: \u00d6skjuhl\u00ed\u00f0, Hl\u00ed\u00f0arendur (with Valur sports club, foe of KR in Vesturb\u00e6r), Klambrat\u00fan park with the Kjarvalssta\u00f0ir art gallery, Hlemmur (food court and bus exchange). -- Laugardalur and Brei\u00f0holt are also interesting areas. Brei\u00f0holt was built with lots of social housing, but in quite a meaningful way that has evolved to be an interesting melting pot in its own right. Laugardalur has a huge pool park with a fitness center and spa, as well as the biggest sports venues. Outside of these areas mentioned you basically have car centric sprawls and then the surrounding municipalities; K\u00f3pavogur then Grafarholt then Hafnarf\u00f6r\u00f0 to the south, Seltjarnarnes on the peninsula to the west and Grafarholt then Mosfellsb\u00e6r in the north-east direction.","title":"Neighbourhoods"},{"location":"guides/neighbourhoods/#reykjaviks-postal-codes-and-neighbourhoods","text":"This is an opinionated guide grasping the geography of Reykjav\u00edk, starting centrally and zooming out.
